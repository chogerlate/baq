"""
This module contains the code for evaluating the model.
- In this case, we develop forecasting models, so the evaluation is done by comparing the predicted values with the actual values.
- The evaluation metrics are the mean absolute error, the mean squared error, and the R-squared score.
- The evaluation is done on the test set.
